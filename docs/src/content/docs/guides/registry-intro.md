## What is a Registry?

In mikr0 architecture, a registry serves as a central repository for your components. It functions similarly to npm, where you can publish different versions of your components. These versions are immutable, ensuring that once a component is published, it cannot be altered. This immutability guarantees consistency and reliability when these components are consumed by various web applications.

## Role of the Registry

The registry plays a crucial role in managing and distributing components across different projects. By centralizing the storage and versioning of components, it allows developers to:

- **Publish Components:** Developers can publish new versions of their components to the registry.
- **Consume Components:** Web applications can consume these published components, ensuring they use the correct and consistent versions.
- **Maintain Immutability:** Once a component version is published, it remains unchanged, providing stability and predictability in your applications.
